Description: Generation of domain variables, linearization of several nonlinear population statistics (the ratio of two totals, weighted income percentile, relative median income ratio, at-risk-of-poverty rate, at-risk-of-poverty threshold, Gini coefficient, gender pay gap, the aggregate replacement ratio, the relative median income ratio, median income below at-risk-of-poverty gap, income quintile share ratio, relative median at-risk-of-poverty gap), computation of regression residuals in case of weight calibration, variance estimation of sample surveys by the ultimate cluster method (Hansen, Hurwitz and Madow,Theory, vol. I: Methods and Applications; vol. II: Theory. 1953, New York: John Wiley and Sons), variance estimation for longitudinal, cross-sectional measures and measures of change for single and multistage stage cluster sampling designs (Berger, Y. G., 2015, <doi:10.1111/rssa.12116>). Several other precision measures are derived - standard error, the coefficient of variation, the margin of error, confidence interval, design effect.
