\title{Linearization of the relative median income ratio}

\description{
Estimates the arelative median income ratio (defined as the ratio of the median equivalised disposable income of people aged above age  to the median equivalised disposable income of those aged below 65) and computes linearized variable for variance estimation.
}


\usage{
linrmir(Y, id, age,
  weight = NULL,
  sort = NULL,
  Dom = NULL,
  period = NULL,
  dataset = NULL,
  order_quant = 50,
  var_name = "lin_rmir")
}


\arguments{
\item{Y}{Study variable (for example equalized disposable income). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{age}{Age variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of at-risk-of-poverty threshold is done for each domain. An object convertible to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character vector, column numbers as numeric vector or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of at-risk-of-poverty threshold is done for each survey period. Object convertible to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character, column numbers as numeric vector or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertible to \code{data.frame}.
}
 
\item{order_quant}{A numeric value in range \eqn{\left[ 0,100 \right]}{[0,100]} for \eqn{\alpha} in the formula for at-risk-of-poverty threshold computation:
\deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
For example, to compute at-risk-of-poverty threshold equal to some percentage of median income, \eqn{\alpha} should be set equal to 50.
}

\item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.
}

}


\details{The implementation strictly follows the Eurostat definition.}


\value{
A list with four objects are returned:
    
\item{value}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated relative median income ratio.
}
  
\item{lin}{A \code{data.table} containing the linearized variables of the relative median income ratio.
}
