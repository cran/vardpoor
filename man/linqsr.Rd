\title{Linearization of the Quintile Share Ratio}

\description{
  Estimate the Quintile Share Ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the sum of equalized disposable income received by the top 20\% to the sum of equalized disposable income received by the bottom 20\%, and its linearization.
}

\usage{
linqsr(Y, id=NULL, weight=NULL, sort = NULL,
       Dom = NULL, period=NULL, dataset = NULL,
       alpha = 20, var_name="lin_qsr")
}

\arguments{

  \item{Y}{Study variable (for example equalized disposable income). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of the income quintile share ratio is done for each domain. An object convertible to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character vector, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of the income quintile share ratio is done for each time period. Object convertible to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertible to \code{data.frame}.}

  \item{alpha}{a numeric value in range \eqn{[0,100]} for the order of the Quintile Share Ratio.}

  \item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.}
}


\value{
  A list with two objects are returned by the function:
  
  \item{value}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated Quintile Share Ratio by G. Osier and Eurostat papers.}
  
  \item{lin}{A \code{data.table} containing the linearized variables of the Quintile Share Ratio by G. Osier paper.}
