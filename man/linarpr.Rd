\title{Linearization of at-risk-of-poverty rate}

\description{
Estimates the at-risk-of-poverty rate (defined as the proportion of persons with equalized disposable income below at-risk-of-poverty threshold) and computes linearized variable for variance estimation.

  weight = NULL,
  Y_thres = NULL,
  wght_thres = NULL,
  sort = NULL,
  Dom = NULL,
  period = NULL,

}


\arguments{
\item{Y}{Study variable (for example equalized disposable income). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{Y_thres}{Variable (for example equalized disposable income) used for computation and linearization of poverty threshold. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}). Variable specified for \code{inc} is used as \code{income_thres} if \code{income_thres} is not defined.
}

\item{wght_thres}{Weight variable used for computation and linearization of poverty threshold. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}). Variable specified for \code{weight} is used as \code{wght_thres} if \code{wght_thres} is not defined.
}

\item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of at-risk-of-poverty threshold is done for each domain. An object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character vector, column numbers as numeric vector or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of at-risk-of-poverty threshold is done for each survey period. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers as numeric vector or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).
}

\item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertible to \code{data.table}.
}

\item{percentage}{A numeric value in range \eqn{\left[ 0,100 \right]}{[0,100]} for \eqn{p} in the formula for at-risk-of-poverty threshold computation:
\deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
For example, to compute at-risk-of-poverty threshold equal to 60\% of some income quantile, \eqn{p} should be set equal to 60.
}
  
\item{order_quant}{A numeric value in range \eqn{\left[ 0,100 \right]}{[0,100]} for \eqn{\alpha} in the formula for at-risk-of-poverty threshold computation:
\deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
For example, to compute at-risk-of-poverty threshold equal to some percentage of median income, \eqn{\alpha} should be set equal to 50.
}

\item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.
}

}


\details{The implementation strictly follows the Eurostat definition.}


\value{
A list with four objects are returned:
  
\item{quantile}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated value of the quintile used for at-risk-of-poverty threshold estimation.
}
  
\item{threshold}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated at-risk-of-poverty threshold.
}
  
\item{value}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated at-risk-of-poverty rate (in percentage).
}
  
\item{lin}{A \code{data.table} containing the linearized variables of the at-risk-of-poverty rate (in percentage).
}
