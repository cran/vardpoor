\title{Linearization of the at-risk-of-poverty rate}

\description{
  Estimate the at-risk-of-poverty rate, which is defined as the
  proportion of persons with equivalized disposable income below
  the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, and its linearization.
}

\usage{
linarpr(inc, id, weight = NULL,
  income_thres = NULL, wght_thres = NULL,
  sort = NULL, Dom = NULL, period = NULL, dataset = NULL,
  percentage = 60, order_quant = 50, na.rm = FALSE,
  var_name = "lin_arpr")
}

\arguments{

  \item{inc}{Study variable (for example equivalized disposable income). One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}


  \item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{income_thres}{Variable (for example equivalized disposable income) used for computation and linearization of poverty threshold. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}). Variable spcified for \code{inc} is used as \code{income_thres} if \code{income_thres} is  not defined.}

  \item{wght_thres}{Weight variable used for computation and linearization of poverty threshold. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}). Variable spcified for \code{weight} is used as \code{wght_thres} if \code{wght_thres} is  not defined.}

  \item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of the at-risk-of-poverty rate is done for each domain. An object convertable to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character vector, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of the at-risk-of-poverty rate is done for each time period. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertable to \code{data.frame}.}

  \item{percentage}{A numeric value in range \eqn{[0,100]} for \eqn{p} in the formula for poverty threshold computation:
  \deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
  For example, to compute poverty threshold equal to 60\% of some income quantile, \eqn{p} should be set equal to 60.}
  
  \item{order_quant}{A numeric value in range \eqn{[0,100]} for \eqn{\alpha} in the formula for poverty threshold computation:
  \deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
  For example, to compute poverty threshold equal to some percentage of median income, \eqn{\alpha} should be set equal to 50.}

  \item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether missing values in study variable should be removed.}

  \item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.}
}

\details{The implementation strictly follows the Eurostat definition.}

\value{
  A list with four objects are returned by the function:
  
  \item{quantile}{A \code{data.frame} containing the estimated value of the quintale used for at-risk-of-poverty threshold estimation.}
  
  \item{threshold}{A \code{data.frame} containing the estimated at-risk-of-poverty threshold.}
  
  \item{value}{A \code{data.frame} containing the estimated at-risk-of-poverty rate. The estimates are done by domains if \code{Dom} is not \code{NULL}.}
  
  \item{lin}{A \code{data.frame} containing the linearized variables of the poverty rate (in precentage). The linearized variables are computed by domains if \code{Dom} is not \code{NULL}.}
