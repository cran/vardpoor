\title{Linearization of the GINI coefficient I}

\description{
  Estimate the Gini coefficient, which is a measure for inequality, and its linearization.
}

\usage{
  lingini(Y, id = NULL, weight = NULL,
          sort = NULL, Dom = NULL, period=NULL,
          dataset = NULL, var_name="lin_gini")
}

\arguments{

  \item{Y}{Study variable (for example equalized disposable income). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of the GINI is done for each domain. An object convertible to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character vector, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of the GINI is done for each time period. Object convertible to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertible to \code{data.frame}.}

  \item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.}
}

\value{

  A list with two objects are returned by the function:

  \item{value}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated Gini coefficients (in percentage) by G. Osier and Eurostat.}
  
  \item{lin}{A \code{data.table} containing the linearized variables of the Gini coefficients (in percentage) by G. Osier.}
