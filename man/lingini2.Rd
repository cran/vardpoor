\title{Linearization of the GINI coefficient II}

\description{
  Estimate the Gini coefficient, which is a measure for inequality, and its linerization.
}

\usage{
lingini2(inc, id = NULL, weight = NULL,
         sort = NULL, Dom = NULL,
         period=NULL, dataset = NULL,
         na.rm = FALSE, var_name="lin_gini2")
}

\arguments{

  \item{inc}{Study variable (for example equivalized disposable income). One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of the GINI is done for each domain. An object convertable to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character vector, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of the GINI is done for each time period. Object convertable to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertable to \code{data.frame}.}

  \item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether missing values in study variable should be removed.}

  \item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.}
}

\value{
 A list with two objects are returned by the function:

  \item{value}{A \code{data.frame} containing the estimated Gini coefficients (in percentage) by Y. Tille and Eurostat papers.}
  
  \item{lin}{A \code{data.frame} containing the linearized variables of the Gini coefficients (in percentage) by Y. Tille paper.}
