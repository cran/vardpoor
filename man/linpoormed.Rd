\title{Linearization of the median income below the at-risk-of-poverty gap}

\description{

The median income of persons below a poverty threshold can be calculated either over the whole population U or over subpopulations. Concerning the poverty threshold, it is calculated as a percentage of an income quantile and is not broken down.

\usage{
linpoormed(inc, id, weight=NULL, sort=NULL,
           Dom=NULL, period=NULL, dataset = NULL,
           percentage=60, order_quant=50,
           na.rm=FALSE, var_name="lin_poormed")
}

\arguments{

  \item{inc}{Study variable (for example equivalized disposable income). One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimentional object convertable to one-column \code{data.frame} or variable name as character, column number or logical vector with only one \code{TRUE} value (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of the at-risk-of-poverty rate is done for each domain. An object convertable to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character vector, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of the at-risk-of-poverty rate is done for each time period. Object convertable to \code{data.frame} or variable names as character, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

  \item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertable to \code{data.frame}.}

  \item{percentage}{A numeric value in range \eqn{[0,100]} for \eqn{p} in the formula for poverty threshold computation:
  \deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
  For example, to compute poverty threshold equal to 60\% of some income quantile, \eqn{p} should be set equal to 60.}
  
  \item{order_quant}{A numeric value in range \eqn{[0,100]} for \eqn{\alpha} in the formula for poverty threshold computation:
  \deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
  For example, to compute poverty threshold equal to some percentage of median income, \eqn{\alpha} should be set equal to 50.}

  \item{na.rm}{A logical value indicating whether missing values in study variable should be removed.}

  \item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.}
}

\value{
  A list with two objects are returned by the function:

  \item{value}{A \code{data.frame} containing the estimated median income below the at-risk-of-poverty gap.}
  
  \item{lin}{A \code{data.frame} containing the linearized variables of the median income below the at-risk-of-poverty gap.}
