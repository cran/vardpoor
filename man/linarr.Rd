\title{Linearization of the aggregate replacement ratio}

\description{
Estimates the aggregate replacement ratio (defined as the gross median individual pension income of the population aged 65-74 relative to the gross median individual earnings from work of the population aged 50-59, excluding other social benefits) and computes linearized variable for variance estimation.
}


\usage{
linarr(Y, Y_den, id = NULL, age, pl085,
       month_at_work, weight = NULL,
       sort = NULL, Dom = NULL, period = NULL,
       dataset = NULL, order_quant = 50,
       var_name = "lin_arr", checking = TRUE)
}


\arguments{
\item{Y}{Numerator variable (for gross pension income). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{Y_den}{Denominator variable (for example gross individual earnings). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{id}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{weight}{Optional weight variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{age}{Age variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{pl085}{Retirement variable (Number of months spent in retirement or early retirement). One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{month_at_work}{Variable for total number of month at work (sum of the number of months spent at full-time work as employee, number of months spent at part-time work as employee, number of months spent at full-time work as self-employed (including family worker), number of months spent at part-time work as self-employed (including family worker)).  One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{sort}{Optional variable to be used as tie-breaker for sorting. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, linearization of at-risk-of-poverty threshold is done for each domain. An object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character vector, column numbers as numeric vector.}

\item{period}{Optional variable for survey period. If supplied, linearization of at-risk-of-poverty threshold is done for each survey period. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers as numeric vector.}

\item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertible to \code{data.table}.}
 
\item{order_quant}{A numeric value in range \eqn{\left[ 0,100 \right]}{[0,100]} for \eqn{\alpha} in the formula for at-risk-of-poverty threshold computation:
\deqn{\frac{p}{100} \cdot Z_{\frac{\alpha}{100}}.}{p/100 * Z(\alpha/100).}
For example, to compute at-risk-of-poverty threshold equal to some percentage of median income, \eqn{\alpha} should be set equal to 50.}

\item{var_name}{A character specifying the name of the linearized variable.}

\item{checking}{Optional variable if this variable is TRUE, then function checks data preparation errors, otherwise not checked. This variable by default is TRUE.}

}


\details{The implementation strictly follows the Eurostat definition.}


\value{
A list with four objects are returned:
    
\item{value}{A \code{data.table} containing the estimated the aggregate replacement ratio.}
  
\item{lin}{A \code{data.table} containing the linearized variables of the aggregate replacement ratio.}
