               ID_level2 = NULL, Dom = NULL, period = NULL,

\arguments{

\item{Y}{Variables of interest. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers.}

\item{H}{The unit stratum variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{PSU}{Primary sampling unit variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{w_final}{Weight variable. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{ID_level1}{Variable for level1 ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{ID_level2}{Optional variable for unit ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{period}{Optional variable for the survey periods. If supplied, the values for each period are computed independently. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers.}

\item{Dom}{Optional variables used to define population domains. If supplied, values are calculated for each domain. An object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character vector, column numbers.}

\item{N_h}{Number of primary sampling units in population for each stratum (and period if \code{period} is not \code{NULL}). If \code{N_h = NULL} and \code{fh_zero = FALSE} (default), \code{N_h} is estimated from sample data as sum of weights (\code{w_final}) in each stratum (and period if \code{period} is not \code{NULL}).

  Optional for single-stage sampling design as it will be estimated from sample data. Recommended for multi-stage sampling design as \code{N_h} can not be correctly estimated from the sample data in this case. If \code{N_h} is not used in case of multi-stage sampling design (for example, because this information is not available), it is advisable to set \code{fh_zero = TRUE}.

  If \code{period} \bold{is} \code{NULL}. A two-column data object convertible to \code{data.table} with rows for each stratum. The first column should contain stratum code. The second column - the number of primary sampling units in the population of each stratum.

  If \code{period} \bold{is not} \code{NULL}. A three-column data object convertible to \code{data.table} with rows for each intersection of strata and period. The first column should contain period. The second column should contain stratum code. The third column - the number of primary sampling units in the population of each stratum and period.
}

\item{PSU_sort}{optional; if PSU_sort is defined, then variance is calculated for systematic sample.}

\item{fh_zero}{by default FALSE; fh is calculated as division of n_h and N_h in each strata, if true, fh value is zero in each strata.}

\item{PSU_level}{by default TRUE; if PSU_level is true, in each strata fh is calculated as division of count of PSU in sample (n_h) and count of PSU in frame (N_h). if PSU_level is false, in each strata fh is calculated as division of count of units in sample (n_h) and count of units in frame (N_h), which calculated as sum of weights.}

\item{Z}{Optional variables of denominator for ratio estimation. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers or logical vector (length of the vector has to be the same as the column count of \code{dataset}).}

\item{dataset}{Optional survey data object convertible to \code{data.table}.}

\item{X}{Optional matrix of the auxiliary variables for the calibration estimator. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers.}

\item{periodX}{Optional variable of the survey periods. If supplied, residual estimation of calibration is done independently for each time period. Object convertible to \code{data.table} or variable names as character, column numbers.}

\item{X_ID_level1}{Variable for level1 ID codes. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{ind_gr}{Optional variable by which divided independently X matrix of the auxiliary variables for the calibration. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{g}{Optional variable of the g weights. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{q}{Variable of the positive values accounting for heteroscedasticity. One dimensional object convertible to one-column \code{data.table} or variable name as character, column number.}

\item{datasetX}{Optional survey data object in level1 convertible to \code{data.table}.}

\item{confidence}{Optional positive value for confidence interval. This variable by default is 0.95.}

\item{percentratio}{Positive numeric value. All linearized variables are multiplied with \code{percentratio} value, by default - 1.}

\item{outp_lin}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE} linearized values of the ratio estimator will be printed out.}

\item{outp_res}{Logical value. If \code{TRUE} estimated residuals of calibration will be printed out.}

}
